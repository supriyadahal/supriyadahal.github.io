  <p>I remember tagging along with my parents for the storybooks in their school libraries. I used to look forward to every new academic year for new textbooks. Each time my dad sat with a book in his hand, I did too. I had a love for reading. Over time, life took its course, and somehow, I drifted away from the magic of books. Determined to rekindle that flame, I set a goal for 2023: to read twelve books by year's end.</p>

    <p>"The New Me" by Halle Butler is a brutally honest and darkly humorous exploration of the modern human condition. Through the character of Millie, a disenchanted temp worker, Butler exposes the relentless monotony and soul-crushing nature of the daily grind. As I followed Millie's struggles and her relentless daydreaming of a better life, I couldn't help but relate to her frustrations and the unfulfilled desires that plague us all. Butler's writing is sharp and incisive, offering biting commentary on contemporary society and the absurdities of our existence. With a mix of self-deprecating humor and raw introspection, "The New Me" challenges societal expectations and forces us to confront the uncomfortable truths we often shy away from. </p>
