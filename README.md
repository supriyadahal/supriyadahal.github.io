  <p>I remember tagging along with my parents for the storybooks in their school libraries. I used to look forward to every new academic year for new textbooks. Each time my dad sat with a book in his hand, I did too. I had a love for reading. Over time, life took its course, and somehow, I drifted away from the magic of books. Determined to rekindle that flame, I set a goal for 2023: to read twelve books by year's end.</p>
